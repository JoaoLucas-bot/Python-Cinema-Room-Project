# Python-Cinema-Room-Project
Objective: Creation of a ticket reservation management system.

Description: Considering a concert hall that has been scheduled for this year 2022 and for the year 2023 several shows (created by the group). The system must contain a menu that allows you to reserve seats, eliminate/change reservations for each show, consult the value from the ticket office.

Basic features:

- Reserve a seat: Each reservation must be associated with the person who paid for it. As soon as the
place is reserved, it is no longer available for a new reservation. the choice of
places must be done in such a way as to optimize the capacity of the room as much as possible.
- Delete reservation: It must be possible to delete reservations already registered. from that
moment reserved seats become available again.
- Change reservation: It must be possible to change the seats of a reservation.
- Consult the value of the ticket office: It must be possible to consult the value obtained:
➢ on a given day;
➢ in a given month;
➢ in a given year.

This system must be implemented taking into account the layout of the room and its price list (the price list is the same for all shows) presented below:
- VIP : 12 euros
- Normal : 4 euros
